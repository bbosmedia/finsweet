						Writing UX copies can be a little frustrating and confusing, and
						sometimes we are unsure about how to get the right word. To crack
						the code for the UX copies, we at Zeta Design wanted to build a
						Figma plugin for the larger design community. The plugin is called
						the Ghost UXWriter and has a set of UX copies cataloged and
						categorized with a voice and tone variation ranging from plain,
						casual to playful. The intention to build this Figma plugin
						originated from our Medium blog post, â€˜Designing voice and tone for
						error messages.
